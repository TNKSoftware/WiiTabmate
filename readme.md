## :question: What's this?

This is a sample script to use the Wii Remote as a one-handed device for painting software.

## :vibration_mode: Disable a vibration

The Wiimote driver DLL used by FreePIE vibrates during initialization. You can disable it by overriding the "Dolphiimote.dll" file in this project.
